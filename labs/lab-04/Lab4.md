1. Added the license, I think. I used the same creative commons footer from the lab document at the bottom of this lab. I also changed the main license of the repo to the creative commons one. 

2. I read the four criteria for free software.

3. Per its basic definition, open-source software must be accessible and usable to anyone who so desires. While it may, initially, seem that adding a license removes this property, it is, in fact, the opposite. Without a license, the project falls under traditional copyright laws, severely limiting how "open" it truly is. In contrast, open-source licensing provides "permission first" to use the software.

4. As mentioned in the previous question, software that does not have a license falls under traditional copyright laws. Therefore, your usage may infringe on their rights. This would make you potentially liable for any fees or damages from your illegal use.  

5. The claim made that Gopher failed due to not following the open system model is sound. For emergent and ambitious technologies like both Gopher and the Web Project, the founding members' goals are likely too much for small teams. Thus, it either needs massive amounts of funding from outside sources or follows the open systems model. Gopher did not have either and thus ultimately failed.

6. To maintain a project's philosophy, it is important that they choose a license that aligns with it. Consider both the MIT and the GNU GPLv3 license. Per [the site choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com/), the MIT License is simple and direct, providing very few restrictions to the end user. This fits a projects whose goal is to be widely adopted and used. One example is Microsoft's .NET. In comparison, the GNU GPLv3 library does allow users to do almost anything, but explicity prohibits sharing closed source distributions. [The site choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com/) describes this as "car[ing] about sharing improvements." Therefore, it makes sense that projects such as Linux would use this license to promote their design philosophy.
